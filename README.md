## **Average Revenue per Sale of 'Paseo':**
To calculate the average sale for a specific product when there are multiple products, we used Excel's built-in functions. Below is the step-by-step explanation of the process:

- Step 1: Filter the Data: We filtered the sales using product name to create a data validation dropdown list to select sales record related to the particular product we wanted to analyze. This was done using Excel's data validation function in the "Data" tab.

- Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue: We calculated the total revenue generated from the sales of the specific product using the ```=SUMIF($C$2:$C$701,T11,J2:J701)``` function in Excel, summing up the revenue column for particular product 'Paseo'.

- Step 3: Calculate Average Sale: We calculated the average revenue generated from the sales of the specific product using the ```=ROUND(AVERAGEIF($C$2:$C$701,T11, J2:J701), 2)``` function in Excel, These function sum up the revenue column for particular product 'Paseo' and divided the total revenue by the number of sales to get the average sale value for the particular product.

- Result: Our analysis show that the average reneue generated from the sales of Paseo is Â£163,421.50.

## **Number of Sales in Government and Midmarket:**
To calculate the number of sale in Government and Midmarket segment, we used ```=COUNTIF()``` function:

- Select a cell where you want to display the count of sales in the Government segment.
- Enter the COUNTIF formula in the cell. The formula syntax is: =COUNTIF(range, criteria).
- For the "range" argument, select the cells in the "Segment" column containing the segment values.
- For the "criteria" argument, enter "Government" (enclosed in double quotes as it is a text value) ```=COUNTIF(A2:A701, "Government")```.
- Repeat the above process fo Midmarket Segment.
- Result: Our Analysis shows that the number of sales in the Government segment is 300 while that of Midmarket is 100.
